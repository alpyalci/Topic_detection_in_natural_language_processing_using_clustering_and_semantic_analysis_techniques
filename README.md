This master’s thesis explores the challenge of detecting and classifying topics in large, unclassified text datasets. Conventional approaches, such as Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), have often fallen short in capturing the semantic depth of the textual data, leading to a need for more sophisticated methodologies.
Addressing this challenge, the study merges clustering and semantic analysis techniques to create a comprehensive topic detection algorithm. The foundation of the methodology lies in sentence embeddings, which have significantly advanced the understanding of text semantics. Using the pretrained model architecture, mpnet-base, these embeddings enable the transformation of textual data into a high-dimensional vector space, where each vector encapsulates the contextual meaning of the corresponding sentence.
However, operating in high-dimensional spaces introduces specific challenges. To address this, the study employs a neural network architecture, primarily designed to make the embeddings topic-aware. This not only reduces the dimensionality of the data but also ensures it is contextually relevant and primed for subsequent analysis stages.
The next phase of the methodology introduces an application of the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) algorithm for text data clustering. When combined with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the resultant toolset offers a method for topic detection. Not only does it reveal the overarching topics within the text corpus, but it also identifies subtopics, providing a granular understanding of the data landscape.
Another key contribution of the research is the development of interactive tools that allow users to fine-tune the analysis parameters. This feature, applicable for local and nested hierarchical clustering, adds a layer of flexibility and user-interaction to the topic detection process, enhancing its practical utility.
Despite these advancements, the study acknowledges certain limitations. The opac- ity of the neural network architecture and the methodology’s reliance on the quality and diversity of the pretrained model present challenges that may impact the effectiveness of the approach.
